    I have learned a lot this semester of web development with Ms.Markley. I have done programming before, but I have never done HTML coding before with a litle bit of Javascript I learned at the very end.
    I am thankful for being apart of this class and I hope to learn more in the future so that I can become better at it.

    Now, on to the things that I have learned this semester at CIS web development with Ms.Markley. But, before I go on a list of about everything I learned this semester I want to demonstrate a couple of topics that I learened
    that have been very momumental to me and will likely help me out in my endeavors in coding. Firstly, one of the most important lessons that i've during this semester of web-dev which I wasn't really able to capture during my stint
    in python programming in CIS 120(Intro to Computer Programming), is my usage of semi-colons. I know back when I was taking Intro my teacher told me that using semi-colons would be a required habit that I would need to do to make sure that my code
    will work
    but I didn't follow that habit during my time with python and I should have learned because the first couple of assignments that I was given this semester I struggled a little bit with errors regarding missing semi-colons and closing statements
    because those two things go hand & hand.
    This semester web-dev has taught me to use that habit and i've had a lot less stressful time with errors. Secondly, the whole understanding of how webpages work and how most of them are made through bootstrap is very helpful for me in the future
    if I want to pursue a career of just making websites for people
    I like doing it, its fun so why not? Lastly, another important topic I have learned this semester has to be the brief stint of Javascript that I have been so graciously taught at the end of this semester and I think that will be very beneficial
    for me when I take Javascript next semester as I won't have to wait to learn the fundamentals
    I can just go straight into the class and get straight to work next semester when that class starts.
